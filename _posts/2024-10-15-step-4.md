# Q: Are _lookaheads_ a type of _zero-width assertion_ that checks for a pattern ahead in the string without _consuming characters._ What does it mean to 'consume characters' and to be of type 'zero-width'.

**Lookaheads** in regular expressions (as well as **lookbehinds**) are a type of **zero-width assertion.** They allow you to check for the presence (or absence) of a pattern **ahead** or **behind** in a string without actually consuming or "eating up" any characters. This can be confusing at first, but it’s an essential concept in regex.

Here the terminology of **"zero-width"** and **"consuming characters"** is explained in more detail.

### 1. Zero-Width Assertions
A **zero-width assertion** in regex refers to a construct that matches a position in the string but **does not consume any characters.** This means that these assertions only check if a certain condition is true (like a lookahead or lookbehind), but they don't move the regex engine's position forward or backward in the string. They "assert" whether a pattern exists at a certain point, but they don't actually include those characters in the final match.

Some common examples of zero-width assertions are:

+ Lookaheads: `(?=...)` and `(?!...)`
+ Lookbehinds: `(?<=...)` and `(?<!...)`
+ Start of string `^` and end of string `$`

**Example of Zero-Width Assertion:**

Consider the regex `\b` (word boundary):

+ A word boundary (`\b`) is a zero-width assertion that checks for the boundary between a word character (`\w`) and a non-word character (`\W`) or the start/end of a string. However, `\b` doesn't consume any characters.

### 2. Consuming Characters
Consuming characters in regex means that the regex engine advances its position in the string as it matches the pattern. When a part of the regex "consumes" a character, it means that the engine has moved past that character and "included" it in the match.

For example:

+ The pattern `\w+` consumes one or more word characters. It matches characters in the string and advances through them until it hits a non-word character.

### 3. Lookaheads: Zero-Width Assertions in Action
A lookahead checks whether a certain pattern exists after the current position in the string but does not consume those characters. After performing the lookahead, the regex engine remains at the same position, and matching continues as if the lookahead were never there.

**Positive Lookahead Example (`(?=...)`):**

Let’s say you want to match a word followed by a digit, but you don't want to include the digit in the match. You can use a lookahead to achieve this.
```python
import re

# Pattern to match any word followed by a digit, but only capture the word
pattern = re.compile(r'\w+(?=\d)')

text = "apple5 banana7 cherry8"

# Find all matches
matches = pattern.findall(text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```
**Explanation:**
+ `\w+` matches one or more word characters (consumes them).
+ `(?=\d)` is a positive lookahead that checks if a digit (`\d`) follows immediately after the word, but it doesn't consume the digit.

Here, the lookahead is a **zero-width** assertion because it simply checks for the presence of a digit without advancing the position in the string. The final result (`'apple'`, `'banana'`, `'cherry'`) does not include the digits (`5`, `7`, `8`), even though they were necessary for the match to succeed.

**Negative Lookahead Example (`(?!...)`):**

A negative lookahead asserts that a pattern does not follow the current position. Again, it doesn’t consume any characters, just checks if the condition is true.
```python
import re

# Pattern to match any word not followed by a digit
pattern = re.compile(r'\w+\b(?!\d)')

text = "apple5 banana cherry"

# Find all matches
matches = pattern.findall(text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['banana', 'cherry']
```
Explanation:

+ `\w+` matches one or more word characters.
+ `\b` matches a word boundary (zero-width).
+ `(?!\d)` is a negative lookahead that asserts no digit follows the word boundary.

In this case, `'apple'` is not included in the result because it's followed by the digit 5, while `'banana'` and `'cherry'` are matched since they aren’t followed by digits.

### 4. Why Zero-Width Assertions Are Useful
+ **Non-Destructive:** Lookaheads and lookbehinds don’t "consume" characters, which means they allow you to check for patterns without altering what gets matched. This makes them ideal for situations where you need to conditionally match parts of a string but don’t want to include the condition in the final result.
+ **Pattern Control:** They give you fine-grained control over the context in which you match a pattern, especially when you need to match something based on what comes before or after it (without including those extra parts).

### 5. "Consuming" Characters in Regex
When a regex pattern consumes characters, it advances through the string, matching and including those characters in the result. Lookaheads don’t do this.

**Example of Consuming Characters:**

In contrast, here's an example of a pattern that **consumes characters:**
```python
import re

# Pattern to match a word followed by a digit, including the digit
pattern = re.compile(r'\w+\d')

text = "apple5 banana7 cherry8"

# Find all matches
matches = pattern.findall(text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['apple5', 'banana7', 'cherry8']

```
Here, the pattern `\w+\d` consumes both the word and the digit. So the result includes the digits along with the words.

### 6. Lookbehind: Another Zero-Width Assertion
Just like lookaheads, lookbehinds are also zero-width assertions, but they check for patterns behind the current position. They do not consume characters either.

**Example of Positive Lookbehind (`(?<=...)`):**
```python
import re

# Pattern to match digits preceded by a word
pattern = re.compile(r'(?<=\w)\d')

text = "apple5 banana7 cherry8"

# Find all matches
matches = pattern.findall(text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['5', '7', '8']
```
**Explanation:**
+ `(?<=\w)` is a positive lookbehind that asserts there is a word character (`\w`) before the digit.
+ `\d` matches the digit.

Here, the lookbehind checks for a word character before each digit but doesn't consume that character, so the result only includes the digits (`5`, `7`, `8`).

#
### Summary:
+ **Zero-Width Assertion:** A regex construct that checks for a pattern but does not consume or advance through the string. Examples: lookaheads (`(?=...), (?!...)`), lookbehinds (`(?<=...), (?<!...)`), word boundaries (`\b`), etc.
+ **Consuming Characters:** When a regex pattern matches and includes characters, advancing through the string as it matches them. Example: `\w+` consumes all word characters it matches.
+ **Lookaheads** and **lookbehinds** are zero-width assertions because they check for patterns ahead or behind the current position without consuming any characters.
